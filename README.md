## Pre-Commit Hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that code is checked for simple issues before it is committed.

### Pre-Commit Hooks Setup

* Install pre-commit: `sudo apt install pre-commit`

### Running the hooks

* Run hooks on every commit: `pre-commit install`
* Running the hooks manually: `pre-commit run --all`
